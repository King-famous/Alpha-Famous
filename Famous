Create sophisticated formatting for your prose and code on GitHub with simple syntax.

Headings
To create a heading, add one to six # symbols before your heading text. The number of # you use will determine the size of the heading.

# The largest heading
## The second largest heading
###### The smallest heading
Rendered H1, H2, and H6 headings

Styling text
You can indicate emphasis with bold, italic, or strikethrough text in comment fields and .md files.

Style	Syntax	Keyboard shortcut	Example	Output
Bold	** ** or __ __	command/control + b	**This is bold text**	This is bold text
Italic	* * or _ _	command/control + i	*This text is italicized*	This text is italicized
Strikethrough	~~ ~~		~~This was mistaken text~~	This was mistaken text
Bold and nested italic	** ** and _ _		**This text is _extremely_ important**	This text is extremely important
All bold and italic	*** ***		***All this text is important***	All this text is important
Quoting text
You can quote text with a >.

Text that is not a quote

> Text that is a quote
Rendered quoted text

Tip: When viewing a conversation, you can automatically quote text in a comment by highlighting the text, then typing r. You can quote an entire comment by clicking , then Quote reply. For more information about keyboard shortcuts, see "Keyboard shortcuts."

Quoting code
You can call out code or a command within a sentence with single backticks. The text within the backticks will not be formatted. You can also press the command or Ctrl + e keyboard shortcut to insert the backticks for a code block within a line of Markdown.

Use `git status` to list all new or modified files that haven't yet been committed.
Rendered inline code block

To format code or text into its own distinct block, use triple backticks.

Some basic Git commands are:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```
Rendered code block

For more information, see "Creating and highlighting code blocks."

Links
You can create an inline link by wrapping link text in brackets [ ], and then wrapping the URL in parentheses ( ). You can also use the keyboard shortcut command + k to create a link. When you have text selected, you can paste a URL from your clipboard to automatically create a link from the selection.

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Rendered link

Tip: GitHub automatically creates links when valid URLs are written in a comment. For more information, see "Autolinked references and URLs."

Section links
You can link directly to a section in a rendered file by hovering over the section heading to expose the link:

Section link within the README file for the github/scientist repository

Relative links
You can define relative links and image paths in your rendered files to help readers navigate to other files in your repository.

A relative link is a link that is relative to the current file. For example, if you have a README file in root of your repository, and you have another file in docs/CONTRIBUTING.md, the relative link to CONTRIBUTING.md in your README might look like this:

[Contribution guidelines for this project](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md)
GitHub will automatically transform your relative link or image path based on whatever branch you're currently on, so that the link or path always works. You can use all relative link operands, such as ./ and ../.

Relative links are easier for users who clone your repository. Absolute links may not work in clones of your repository - we recommend using relative links to refer to other files within your repository.

Images
You can display an image by adding ! and wrapping the alt text in[ ]. Then wrap the link for the image in parentheses ().

![This is an image](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)

Rendered Image

GitHub supports embedding images into your issues, pull requests, discussions, comments and .md files. You can display an image from your repository, add a link to an online image, or upload an image. For more information, see "Uploading assets."

Tip: When you want to display an image which is in your repository, you should use relative links instead of absolute links.

Here are some examples for using relative links to display an image.

Context	Relative Link
In a .md file on the same branch	/assets/images/electrocat.png
In a .md file on another branch	/../main/assets/images/electrocat.png
In issues, pull requests and comments of the repository	../blob/main/assets/images/electrocat.png
In a .md file in another repository	/../../../../github/docs/blob/main/assets/images/electrocat.png
In issues, pull requests and comments of another repository	../../../github/docs/blob/main/assets/images/electrocat.png?raw=true
Note: The last two relative links in the table above will work for images in a private repository only if the viewer has at least read access to the private repository which contains these images.

For more information, see "Relative Links."

Lists
You can make an unordered list by preceding one or more lines of text with - or *.

- George Washington
- John Adams
- Thomas Jefferson
Rendered unordered list

To order your list, precede each line with a number.

1. James Madison
2. James Monroe
3. John Quincy Adams
Rendered ordered list

Nested Lists
You can create a nested list by indenting one or more list items below another item.

To create a nested list using the web editor on GitHub or a text editor that uses a monospaced font, like Atom, you can align your list visually. Type space characters in front of your nested list item, until the list marker character (- or *) lies directly below the first character of the text in the item above it.

1. First list item
   - First nested list item
     - Second nested list item
Nested list with alignment highlighted

List with two levels of nested items

To create a nested list in the comment editor on GitHub, which doesn't use a monospaced font, you can look at the list item immediately above the nested list and count the number of characters that appear before the content of the item. Then type that number of space characters in front of the nested list item.

In this example, you could add a nested list item under the list item 100. First list item by indenting the nested list item a minimum of five spaces, since there are five characters (100. ) before First list item.

100. First list item
     - First nested list item
List with a nested list item

You can create multiple levels of nested lists using the same method. For example, because the first nested list item has seven characters (␣␣␣␣␣-␣) before the nested list content First nested list item, you would need to indent the second nested list item by seven spaces.

100. First list item
     - First nested list item
       - Second nested list item
List with two levels of nested items

For more examples, see the GitHub Flavored Markdown Spec.

Task lists
To create a task list, preface list items with a regular space character followed by [ ]. To mark a task as complete, use [x].

- [x] #739
- [ ] https://github.com/octo-org/octo-repo/issues/740
- [ ] Add delight to the experience when all tasks are complete :tada:
Rendered task list

If a task list item description begins with a parenthesis, you'll need to escape it with \:

- [ ] \(Optional) Open a followup issue

For more information, see "About task lists."

Mentioning people and teams
You can mention a person or team on GitHub by typing @ plus their username or team name. This will trigger a notification and bring their attention to the conversation. People will also receive a notification if you edit a comment to mention their username or team name. For more information about notifications, see "About notifications."

@github/support What do you think about these updates?

Rendered @mention

When you mention a parent team, members of its child teams also receive notifications, simplifying communication with multiple groups of people. For more information, see "About teams."

Typing an @ symbol will bring up a list of people or teams on a project. The list filters as you type, so once you find the name of the person or team you are looking for, you can use the arrow keys to select it and press either tab or enter to complete the name. For teams, enter the @organization/team-name and all members of that team will get subscribed to the conversation.

The autocomplete results are restricted to repository collaborators and any other participants on the thread.

Referencing issues and pull requests
You can bring up a list of suggested issues and pull requests within the repository by typing #. Type the issue or pull request number or title to filter the list, and then press either tab or enter to complete the highlighted result.

For more information, see "Autolinked references and URLs."

Referencing external resources
If custom autolink references are configured for a repository, then references to external resources, like a JIRA issue or Zendesk ticket, convert into shortened links. To know which autolinks are available in your repository, contact someone with admin permissions to the repository. For more information, see "Configuring autolinks to reference external resources."

Content attachments
Some GitHub Apps provide information in GitHub for URLs that link to their registered domains. GitHub renders the information provided by the app under the URL in the body or comment of an issue or pull request.

Content attachment

To see content attachments, you must have a GitHub App that uses the Content Attachments API installed on the repository. For more information, see "Installing an app in your personal account" and "Installing an app in your organization."

Content attachments will not be displayed for URLs that are part of a markdown link.

For more information about building a GitHub App that uses content attachments, see "Using Content Attachments."

Uploading assets
You can upload assets like images by dragging and dropping, selecting from a file browser, or pasting. You can upload assets to issues, pull requests, comments, and .md files in your repository.

Using emoji
You can add emoji to your writing by typing :EMOJICODE:.

@octocat :+1: This PR looks great - it's ready to merge! :shipit:

Rendered emoji

Typing : will bring up a list of suggested emoji. The list will filter as you type, so once you find the emoji you're looking for, press Tab or Enter to complete the highlighted result.

For a full list of available emoji and codes, check out the Emoji-Cheat-Sheet.

Paragraphs
You can create a new paragraph by leaving a blank line between lines of text.

Footnotes
You can add footnotes to your content by using this bracket syntax:

Here is a simple footnote[^1].

A footnote can also have multiple lines[^2].  

You can also use words, to fit your writing style more closely[^note].

[^1]: My reference.
[^2]: Every new line should be prefixed with 2 spaces.  
  This allows you to have a footnote with multiple lines.
[^note]:
    Named footnotes will still render with numbers instead of the text but allow easier identification and linking.  
    This footnote also has been made with a different syntax using 4 spaces for new lines.
The footnote will render like this:

Rendered footnote

Note: The position of a footnote in your Markdown does not influence where the footnote will be rendered. You can write a footnote right after your reference to the footnote, and the footnote will still render at the bottom of the Markdown.

Hiding content with comments
You can tell GitHub to hide content from the rendered Markdown by placing the content in an HTML comment.

<!-- This content will not appear in the rendered Markdown -->
Ignoring Markdown formatting
You can tell GitHub to ignore (or escape) Markdown formatting by using \ before the Markdown character.

Let's rename \*our-new-project\* to \*our-old-project\*.

Rendered escaped character

For more information, see Daring Fireball's "Markdown Syntax."

Disabling Markdown rendering
When viewing a Markdown file, you can click  at the top of the file to disable Markdown rendering and view the file's source instead.

Display Markdown as source

Disabling Markdown rendering enables you to use source view features, such as line linking, which is not possible when viewing rendered Markdown files.
